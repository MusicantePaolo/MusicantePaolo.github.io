               The source originally used for bottling Sant'Anna Water was the one in Vinadio, located at 1503 m above sea level. However, starting from the 2000s, a second source from which water is drawn was added: the Rebruant spring. In reality, the latter consists of four different springs belonging to the same hydrogeological basin, the highest of which is located at 1950 m above sea level.

               The company markets the waters from the two sources with different labels, in fact one is sold in discount stores and the other throughout the GDO network. The earliest written records regarding the waters of the Vinadio sources date back to the 16th century, in historical documents that extol the lightness of the water drunk by pilgrims climbing to the Sanctuary of Sant'Anna.
