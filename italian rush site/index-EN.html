               <h2>Game Plot</h2>
               <p>
                  Eddy is a young man suffering from a compulsive disorder that drives him to run endlessly through the Italian cities. This incessant movement becomes a sort of escape from the reality surrounding him, a way to flee from the obsessive thoughts that constantly torment him.
                  <br>
                  His story begins in the majestic Rome, a city shining with history and culture. Here, among ancient ruins and iconic monuments, Eddy starts his mad race in search of something he cannot define. Through busy streets and quiet alleys, he encounters scenes of everyday life that push him deeper into himself.
                  <br>
                  From the capital, Eddy heads south, exploring the bustling Naples. Among the winding streets of the historic center and vibrant neighborhoods, Eddy finds himself immersed in a whirlwind of colors, smells, and sounds. It's here that he begins to confront his inner demons, finding comfort in the vibrant energy of the city and the warm hospitality of its inhabitants.
                  <br>
                  His escape continues northward, to the romantic Venice. Among the winding canals and enchanting squares, Eddy plunges into a world of timeless beauty. But it's also here that he realizes he can no longer run away from his problems. It's only by confronting the past and facing his fears that he can find the inner peace he so desperately desires.
                  <br>
                  Through his adventures in these three iconic cities, Eddy embarks on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth that will lead him to accept himself and find the strength to confront his inner demons.

               <h2 >Statue of Caesar</h2>
               <p>Gaius Julius Caesar was an important Roman general, politician, and consul in the 1st century BC. He is particularly known for his military campaigns that led to the conquest of Gaul and his subsequent rise to power in Rome. Caesar was also a skilled strategist and reformer, known for his eloquence and political acumen.<br> However, his ambition and desire for power brought him into conflict with the Roman elite, culminating in his assumption of power as perpetual dictator. His death at the hands of a group of conspiring senators in 44 BC marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Empire.</p>

               <p>San Gennaro is the patron saint of Naples, as well as one of the most venerated saints in Italy. He is particularly known for the so-called "miracle of the blood," an event that occurs three times a year during the celebration of his relics. It is said that his blood, preserved in two vials in the Naples Cathedral, becomes liquid on those days, thus manifesting his miraculous intervention in favor of the city. San Gennaro, bishop of Benevento, was martyred during the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian in the 4th century AD. His figure is celebrated not only in Naples but also in many other parts of the world where Neapolitan communities are present.</p>

               <p>Vittorio Emanuele II was the first king of Italy, also known as the "Father of the Fatherland." He was one of the protagonists of the Italian Risorgimento, the movement that led to the unification of the various Italian states into a single nation. Born in 1820, Vittorio Emanuele II became king of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1849, succeeding his father Carlo Alberto. Through skillful diplomatic maneuvers and military alliances, he led the process of Italian unification, defeating foreign domination and fostering the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, with himself as sovereign. His reign also saw the conquest of Rome in 1870, thus completing the country's unification. Vittorio Emanuele II is remembered as a king of great political ability and as a symbol of Italian national unity.</p>
